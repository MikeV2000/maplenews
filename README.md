## Available Scripts

In each package directory, you can run:

### `yarn build`
Builds the package for production to the `build` folder.

### `yarn depcheck`
Checks the package.json for unused dependencies. Don't rely too heavily on this, it's more like a guideline.

### `yarn sort`
Sorts the package.json.

### `yarn start`
Runs the package in the development mode.

The package will reload if you make edits.

### `yarn ts`
Checks package for typescript errors.
