# Maple News Network
In the past decade the way we consume our media has changed. 30 minute, and 60 minute news segments on TV, have been replaced with silly memes, while news paper columns have been replaced with 280 character snippets.

Traditional media is dying, but it's not all that has died. Our trust for corporate news media has also died. Shouts of "Fake News" have come from everywhere, including the President of the United States.

It's very clear that the media is no longer trusted, and social media, which has become its replacement, can be a very dangerous place to get information. Here stories spread so quickly, that they can be around the world before they are can be verified as true or false.

We, at Maple News Network, recognize these problems, and our goal is to provide a solution.

How will we do this?

We will give you the facts and the numbers. Interpreting the news is up to you. We will give you the information, so you can make your own decision.

Through algorithms and AI, we will detect the breaking news stories, and display what's most relevant to you.
